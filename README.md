# Psp-docker-Rhasspy.

My way to build and use Rhasspy in a Docker container.
I works with Rhasspy 2.5.5 and properly >2.5.5
I use it one my Linux Desktop PC, with a usb microphone and the desktop's speakers.
But that you can configure in the Rhasspy web interface.

Read [Installing](#Installing).

## Installing.
`build.sh` builds the docker images and the Rhasspy.
  - Go into the rhasspy folder: `cd rhasspy`
  - Enter **`"bash build.sh"`**
  - With `"bash build.sh"` you get the right UID and GID in the image and the container.

- When finished building  enter: `"docker-compose up -d"`.
-  Visit `localhost:12101` in your browser.

#### Running Rhasspy container Manual.
You can run "rhasspy" manually edit the docker-compose.yml and comment out:
- `#command: /home/pi/bin/rhasspy`  and afterward entering: `"docker-compose exec rhasspy bash"`.
And inside the container enter: `"rhasspy"`.

#### Running Rhasspy container  Automatic.
To run "rhasspy" automatically edit the docker-compose.yml and un-comment:
- `#command: /home/pi/bin/rhasspy`

Then enter `"docker-compose up -d"`.

To shutdown the Rhasspy container enter: `"docker-compose down"`.

##### You want to expose the internal mqtt broker.
 - Edit the docker-compose.yml and un-comment this line:
- `#- "1883:12183"`

##### You want to watch the log in the terminal.
 - Use the combination:  `"docker-compose up;docker-compose down"`.
